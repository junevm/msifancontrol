`msifancontrol` is a Terminal User Interface (TUI) for managing fan speeds on MSI laptops. It provides direct access to the Embedded Controller (EC), allowing for custom fan curves, basic profiles, and "Cooler Boost" mode—all wrapped in a dreamy 90s vaporwave aesthetic.

### Features

- ⚡ **Auto-Elevation**: Prompts for sudo only when needed to access `/dev/port`.
- 📊 **Multiple Profiles**: Support for Auto, Basic, Advanced (custom curves), and Cooler Boost.
- 🎨 **Beautiful TUI**: Built with Bubble Tea and Lip Gloss for a high-quality terminal experience.
- 🛠️ **Auto-Setup**: Helper scripts to ensure kernel modules like `ec_sys` are correctly configured.

### Supported Models

Tested primarily on the **MSI GF65 Thin 9SD**.

> [!WARNING]
> Writing to the EC memory can be dangerous. While this tool uses well-known offsets for MSI laptops, ensure your model is compatible before use.
